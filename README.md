NeoPixel_Goggles
================

Arduino code for 16 pixel NeoPixel rings

I modified the Adafruit sample code.
I removed the random pixel animation
I added code for using a button press to cycle through the colors instead of a timer (R,G,B).
I also added code for using a button press to cycle through brightnesses (85,170,255).


In future versions I might try to add sound reactivity.
